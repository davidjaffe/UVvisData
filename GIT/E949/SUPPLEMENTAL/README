*** E949 Results presented in arXiv:0903.0030
*** In each file:
*** column 1:  K+ --> pi+ nu nubar branching ratio (br) times 10e10
*** column 2:  Signal confidence level (cls) as defined by method of
            T.Junk. (NIM A434, 435 (1999)). 
	    All uncertainties have been included via a weighted sum method.

cls_SM.dat  - br vs cls interpreted with a SM spectral shape using results from both kinematic regions.
cls_SM_I.dat - idem     using results in pnn1 region only.
cls_SM_II.dat - idem    using results in pnn2 region only

cls_scalar.dat - interpreted using a scalar spectral shape
cls_scalar_I.dat
cls_scalar_II.dat

cls_tensor.dat - interpreted using a tensor spectral shape
